## Introduction
In this guide, you will find helpful information to get you started on setting up docker for contributing to the project.

Docker is a powerful tool that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight and provide an isolated environment for your applications, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistent development across different operating systems.
